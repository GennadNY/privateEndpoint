# Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server Networking with Private Link - Preview

Private Link allows you to create private endpoints for Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Single server to bring it inside your Virtual Network (VNet), in addition to already [existing networking capabilities provided by VNET injection](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/concepts-networking). With Private Link,traffic between your virtual network and the service travels the Microsoft backbone network. Exposing your service to the public internet is no longer necessary. You can create your own private link service in your virtual network and deliver it to your customers. Setup and consumption using Azure Private Link is consistent across Azure PaaS, customer-owned, and shared partner services.
A Private Endpoint adds a network interface to a resource, providing it with a private IP address assigned from your VNET (Virtual Network). Once applied, you can communicate with this resource exclusively via the virtual network (VNET).
For a list to PaaS services that support Private Link functionality, review the Private Link [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/). A private endpoint is a private IP address within a specific [VNet](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview) and Subnet.
